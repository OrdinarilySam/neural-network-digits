# Neural Network
This is going to be my attempt at creating a neural network in Python (without using Pytorch or TensorFlow).

It's going to attempt to analyze the MNIST dataset, which is a dataset of handwritten digits.

If this is successful, I will try to build a GUI that can be used to draw a digit in real time and have the neural network predict what digit it is.
